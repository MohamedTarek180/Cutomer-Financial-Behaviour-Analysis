# Customer Financial Behavior Analysis
This repository contains an analysis aimed at understanding customer financial behavior by linking current application data with previous applications. The objective is to identify patterns in loan uptake and repayment, enabling the prediction of repayment outcomes and the detection of potential defaulters.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outlier removal, feature selection, and feature engineering. Summary Statistics: Provided visual and statistical insights into key metrics. Model Evaluation: Compared various models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting Machine. Model Improvement: Implemented upsampling and regularization techniques to improve recall. Business Impact Analysis: Highlighted improvements in risk assessment, loan approvals, and targeted marketing. Future Enhancements: Plans for advanced feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and real-time model deployment.
